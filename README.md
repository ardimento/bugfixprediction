# bugfixprediction
This repository contains the implementation for predicting bug-fixing time using transformer-based language models. The models evaluated include ALBERT, DistilBERT, and Google BERT. The dataset consists of bug reports extracted from LiveCode's Bugzilla, with textual features such as bug descriptions and developer comments used for training.
